## ðŸš€ Project Structure

The project has the following folders structure:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Base.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` files in the `src/pages/` directory.
Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Static assets like images are placed in the `public/` directory.
